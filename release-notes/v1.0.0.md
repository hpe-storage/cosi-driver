## Known Issues

Known issues for HPE COSI Driver v1.0.0 release.

* The HPE COSI driver can be deployed only in the `default` namespace due to a [bug](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/container-object-storage-interface-provisioner-sidecar/issues/140) in creating events in the COSI API objects when deployed in non-default namespaces.
* Creating `BucketClaim` or `BucketAccess` objects in parallel can cause failures in the COSI driver. A [bug](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/container-object-storage-interface-api/issues/101) has been filed to address this issue.
* A warning event is created in the `Bucket` or `BucketAccess` resources when an error occurs, and has a life-span of one hour. During this period, if the error is resolved the Status will show `Bucket Ready: true` or `Access Granted: true` in the `Bucket` or `BucketAccess` respectively, but the warning event will persist till an hour lapses. A [bug](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/container-object-storage-interface-api/issues/103) has been raised to resolve this ambiguity.
* Recreation of `BucketClaim` or `BucketAccess` objects doesn't work intermittently, as gRPC request is not sent to the COSI driver. This [pull request](https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/container-object-storage-interface-api/pull/86) will address the issue.
